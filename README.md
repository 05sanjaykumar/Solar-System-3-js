## 🚀 Features
- 🌞 Realistic Sun and planets with proper orbits
- 🌍 Earth with a **realistic texture**
- 🌙 Moon orbiting Earth
- 🪐 Saturn with **rotating rings**
- ✨ 3D stars background for a **space effect**
- 🎥 Camera movement with mouse (OrbitControls)
- 🔆 Lighting for a more immersive experience
